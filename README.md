# market-anomaly-detection

## Project Details

This project involves building an anomaly detection system that serves as an early warning mechanism for identifying potential financial market crashes before they occur. Using data and machine learning models, your system should classify market conditions and propose investment strategies for risk mitigation and optimization.

#### Requirements:

**Milestone 1:** Develop an anomaly detection model using either [this provided dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JTyt47mka5DSX3mX9VQTxZaIEQd6OVm9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111459758733253895997&rtpof=true&sd=true) or your own to classify market crashes. This is a binary output: crash or no crash. Perform statistical research to select and implement the most effective machine learning model for the task, such as logistic regression, neural networks, etc.

##### Future
**Milestone 2:** Enhance the system by proposing a data-driven investment strategy based on the model’s predictions, focusing on minimizing losses or maximizing returns.
- Incorporate [RSI](https://rbdundas.medium.com/calculate-relative-strength-index-rsi-and-chart-with-candles-using-python-pandas-and-matplotlib-f58d926249ac)
       
**Milestone 3:** Design and integrate an AI-driven bot to explain the investment strategy to end users, making it accessible and actionable.
